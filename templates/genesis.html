            <h1>Hello! Welcome to the Zero Framework Blog.</h1>
            <p>
                As the illustrious and innovative title suggests, this is indeed
                technically a Zero framework blog. Everything you see, including
                internal libraries and frameworks, is 100% built from scratch.
                This blog allows you to write posts in Markdown and Replit users
                to comment on your posts. Under the hood, the blog features a
                vanilla server, file template renderer, and a custom frontend
                web component framework.
            </p>

            <p>
                You will be able to read more about the technical details and
                project timeline on the Hello World post after you go through
                this setup process.
            </p>

            <h2>Wait a minute...</h2>
            <p>
                This doesn't look like a blog!? You're right. This is the first
                ever onboarding process for a Replit template, to help you get
                up to speed. Pretty sick huh? After going through the setup
                process, we'll turn off this page and you'll have access to the
                blog.
            </p>

            <h2>How to use this stuff</h2>
            <p>
                Simple. Just add a Markdown file in the "posts" directory and
                that's it. The filename will be the url path to access the post,
                so make sure it looks pretty. Again, you'll find some more
                details in the Hello World post.
            </p>

            <h2>Setting Things up</h2>
            <p>
                We'll need some information to help us customize your blog.
                Don't worry - everything will be literally written to the files
                of this Repl, this data does not travel anywhere.
            </p>

            <p>
                NOTE: if this is the offical template release, your changes will
                not affect the blog because I don't want you to overwrite my
                profile. Fork this project and disable "demo" in
                "configInternals.json"
            </p>
